    I am Divyanshu Dhruw, a student from India pursuing bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I created this website so that people from every part of world could get access to my profile and know me from the surface.
    <br /><br />
    My motto in life is to live my life as I want. I have lots of dreams that I want to complete, lots of lives that I want to live, lots of ambition driving me through.
